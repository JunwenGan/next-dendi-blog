## Introduction

Building a blog with Next.js and MDX gives you the best of both worlds: the power of React components with the simplicity of Markdown. In this guide, I'll walk you through how I built this very blog.

<Callout type="info" title="What You'll Learn">
- Setting up MDX in Next.js
- Creating a file-based blog system
- Adding custom components to MDX
- Styling your blog posts
</Callout>

## Why MDX?

MDX lets you write JSX directly in your Markdown files. This means you can:

1. **Import components** - Use React components in your posts
2. **Interactive content** - Add charts, code playgrounds, etc.
3. **Consistent styling** - Apply your design system everywhere

## Project Setup

First, create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog
cd my-blog
```

Then install the MDX dependencies:

```bash
npm install next-mdx-remote gray-matter
```

## File Structure

Organize your posts in a `content` folder:

```
content/
  posts/
    hello-world.mdx
    my-first-post.mdx
```

## Reading MDX Files

Create a utility function to read and parse MDX files:

```typescript
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import matter from 'gray-matter';

export async function getPostBySlug(slug: string) {
  const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'content/posts', `${slug}.mdx`);
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
  const { data, content } = matter(fileContents);

  return { frontmatter: data, content };
}
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
Make sure to add proper error handling for cases when files don't exist!
</Callout>

## Custom Components

The real power of MDX comes from custom components. Here's how to create a callout:

```tsx
export default function Callout({ type, title, children }) {
  return (
    <div className={`callout callout-${type}`}>
      <strong>{title}</strong>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Building a blog with Next.js and MDX is straightforward once you understand the basics. The combination gives you:

- Great developer experience
- Full control over styling
- Ability to add interactive elements
- SEO-friendly static pages

Happy blogging!
