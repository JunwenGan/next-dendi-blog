## Welcome!

Welcome to my portfolio! This is my first blog post using MDX.

<Callout type="tip" title="What is MDX?">
MDX lets you use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, like the Callout you're reading now, and embed them directly in your posts.
</Callout>

## What's New?

Here's what I've been working on:

- File-based blog posts using MDX
- Modern portfolio architecture
- Guestbook functionality
- Projects showcase

## What to Expect

I'll be sharing insights on:

1. **Frontend Development** - React, Next.js, TypeScript tips and tricks
2. **Tools & Productivity** - My favorite dev tools and workflows
3. **Design** - UI/UX thoughts and Tailwind CSS patterns

Stay tuned for more updates!
