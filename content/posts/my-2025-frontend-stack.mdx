<Callout type="info" title="Why the Right Stack Matters">
The tools you choose shape your development experience. A well-curated stack not only boosts productivity but also makes coding enjoyable and sustainable in the long run.
</Callout>

## Introduction

As a Frontend Developer in 2025, my development workflow is centered around tools that enable me to work faster and more effectively. The right tools help me write clean code, manage projects efficiently, and maintain a highly optimized environment.

## My Stack

Here's what I use daily:

### Code Editor

**VS Code** remains my primary editor, enhanced with these extensions:
- GitHub Copilot for AI-assisted coding
- Prettier for code formatting
- ESLint for catching issues early
- GitLens for git superpowers

### Framework

**Next.js 15** is my go-to framework:
- App Router for modern React patterns
- Server Components for performance
- Built-in optimization features

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
Use `turbopack` in development for significantly faster hot module replacement. Just add `--turbopack` to your dev script.
</Callout>

### Styling

**Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** is the perfect combo:
- Utility-first approach speeds up development
- Consistent design system
- Great dark mode support

### Database & Backend

- **Prisma** for type-safe database access
- **PostgreSQL** (via Neon) for reliable data storage
- **NextAuth** for authentication

## Productivity & Utilities

- **Warp** - Modern terminal with AI features
- **Raycast** - Launcher on steroids
- **Arc Browser** - My daily driver for web browsing

## Final Thoughts

The key to a great stack isn't using the most tools—it's using the right ones. Focus on tools that solve real problems in your workflow and don't be afraid to change things up when better options come along.

What's in your stack? I'd love to hear about it!
