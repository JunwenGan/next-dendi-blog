## Overview

Image to Voxel is an innovative AI-powered application that transforms text prompts into stunning voxel-art HTML scenes. The project combines multiple AI technologies to create a seamless creative workflow.

## How It Works

The application follows a two-step AI pipeline:

1. **Prompt-to-Image Generation**: Using OpenAI's image generation API, the system creates clean subject images on simple backgrounds based on user prompts.

2. **Voxel Scene Generation**: Google Gemini then analyzes the generated image and creates a single-page Three.js HTML file that renders the subject as interactive voxel art.

## Key Features

- **Text-to-Image**: Generate images from natural language descriptions
- **AI-Powered Voxelization**: Automatic conversion of 2D images to 3D voxel scenes
- **Interactive 3D Viewer**: Rotate, zoom, and explore your voxel creations
- **Downloadable HTML**: Export self-contained HTML files with embedded Three.js
- **Real-time Preview**: Instant visualization of generated content

## Technical Implementation

The frontend is built with Next.js and TypeScript, providing a responsive and type-safe development experience. The UI uses Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a clean and modern aesthetic.

The backend integrates with multiple AI services:
- OpenAI API for image generation
- Google Gemini for code generation and image analysis

Three.js powers the 3D rendering, creating interactive voxel scenes that users can manipulate in real-time.
